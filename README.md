# TheRealDonald

This app was written for a TurnToTech Hackathon. The purpose of this app is to get headline articles related to Donald Trump 
and ask you if the headline was real or not. There are fake headlines that were created by us to try to throw the person
playing off, a long with ridiculous pictures of Donald Trump. 
The articles were taken from The New York Times using their api (https://developer.nytimes.com/).
